**Project Name** - Work Order Management Optimization

### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to improve work order management in a service management system. Currently, work order activities are not being tracked efficiently, leading to delays in problem resolution, customer dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiencies. This project aims to optimize work order completion times and enhance overall operational efficiency.

### Expected Outcome:
- Improve tracking and management of work orders.
- Optimize task completion times.
- Enhance operational efficiency by identifying patterns and improving task allocation.

### Research Questions:
- **Task Frequency and Resource Allocation:** Identifying patterns in task occurrences and resource allocation.
- **Client-Specific Task Patterns:** Analyzing client-specific trends in work orders.
- **Cross-Client Issue Similarity:** Exploring similarities in issues across clients to improve resolution processes.
- **High-Effort Task Improvement:** Identifying tasks that consume significant effort and proposing improvements.
- **Task Duration Optimization:** Optimizing the time taken to complete tasks.

### Data Pre-processing & Cleaning:
- **Duplicate Removal:** Ensured the dataset contains unique records by removing duplicates.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and handled outliers to maintain data integrity.
- **Handling Missing/Null Values:** Managed missing or null values through imputation or removal.
- **Invalid Data Removal:** Removed data entries that were invalid or did not fit the required format.

### Data Transformation:
- **Datetime Conversion:** Converted time series data into a standard `Datetime` format to facilitate accurate time-based analysis.

### Data Validation:
- Separated the dataset into two parts to check for negative values in the total seconds field and removed invalid rows where necessary.

### Feature Engineering:
- **Start to Added Time Difference:** Calculated the time difference between the start time and added time for each work order.
- **Start to Completed Time Difference:** Calculated the time difference between the start time and completion time for each work order.
- **Time-Based Features:** Extracted features such as year, month, date, and time from datetime values to enhance analysis.

This project leverages these techniques to provide a deeper understanding of work order patterns and optimize management strategies for improved operational performance.
